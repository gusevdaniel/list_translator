# list_translator

The list_translator function translates word lists in unlimited volume for free.

It takes about 20 minutes to translate 90,000 words.


You should also know that one translation request must be less than 5000 characters.
By default, the size of a single query is 200 words.

With an average word length of 15 characters, we get:
  15 * 200 = 3000 characters.
